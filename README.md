Assignment:
Create a program that contains collision simulations and an arcade game.

The arcade game has to include: 
- Win/lose condition(s)
- Three or more game states
- Collisions
- An animation
- A parallax scrolling background
- A highscore table saved to a file with the 5 highest scores on it. This file must also store a corresponding name on it for each score. This name needs to be a three-letter word that the user selects.

The collision simulations needed are:
- Circle vs circle collisions
- Circle vs axis-aligned bounding box collisions
- Circle vs line segment collisions
- Axis-aligned bounding box vs axis-aligned bounding box collisions


How to use the program:
Upon starting up the program you are faced with a main menu. You can press space to play the game. The game is a recreation of Atari's classic game Breakout. To control the paddle use the left and right arrow keys. Try to get the highest score you can. Once you lose you can type in the 3 character name you want to affiliate with your score. Press space to play again.

At any point during this gameplay loop you can press the "Switch Mode" button in the top left corner of the program to switch over to the collision simulation mode. This mode contains 4 modes which you can switch between with the buttons on the bottom of the screen. You can drag the shapes on screen around in these simulations and collisions are indicated by the text under the switch mode button.

Press the switch mode button again if you wish to return back to the game.
